As
soon
as
you
start
a
Nanodegree
program
you
join
other
students
who
are
working
towards
the
same
credential.
You
interact
with
your
fellow

How
do
you
build
the
curriculum
for
a
Nanodegree
program
Our
curriculum
managers
partner
with
hiring
managers
and
subject
matter
experts
from
leading
companies
to
define
the
skills
required
to
qualify
for
a
job
in
that
field
The
programs
are
designed
to
teach
these
skills
through
building
portfolio-ready
projects
and
solving
real-world
problems
Why
will
a
Nanodegree
program
curriculum
prepare
me
for
a
job
better
than
other
online
courses
The
Nanodegree
program
curriculum
is
built
with
exclusive
input
from
leading
industry
employers
who
know
exactly
what
skills
they
are
looking
for
in
their
candidates
The
skills
taught
in
our
programs
are
immediately
applicable
in
the
current
job
market
and
the
portfolio
projects
you
build
as
part
of
your
Nanodegree
program
will
demonstrate
your
skills
to
hiring
managers
How
is
a
Nanodegree
program
curriculum
different
from
taking
multiple
courses?
All
our
programs
feature
expert
instructors
teaching
critical
and
cutting-edge
skills
For
those
pursuing
mastery
of
a
particular
skill
or
who
wish
to
craft
an
independent
study
path
a
self-designed
menu
of
individual
courses
can
be
an
excellent
option
However
features
such
as
project
review
moderated
peer
forums
career
support
and
an
awarded
credential
are
only
available
to
students
enrolled
in
a
Nanodegree
program

don’t
know

Nanodegree
program

Is
there
an
admissions
process
If
yes
what
is
it
We
do
have
an
admissions
process
for
some
of
our
advanced
Nanodegree
programs
such
as
the
Self-Driving
Car
Nanodegree
program
We
use
the
admissions
process
to
ensure
students
are
ready
to
succeed
in
the
program
When
does
each
program
begin
It
depends
on
the
Nanodegree
program
Our
self-paced
Nanodegree
programs
are
always
open
for
enrollment
you
can
start
a
credential
at
any
time
on-demand
and
at
times
that

your
Ad

schedule
Our
cohorted
programs
have
specific
start
and
end
dates
and

How
much
time
will
it
take
to
complete
a
Nanodegree
program
Our
Nanodegree
programs
vary
in
length
and
we
provide
an
estimate
of
how
long
each
program
will
take
on
the
Program
Overview
page
Most
Nanodegree
programs
take
between
6
months
to
a
year
to
complete
Some
Nanodegree
programs
are
self-paced
so
students
can
complete
the
program
as
quickly
or
as
slowly
as
they
like
The
time
estimates
for
these
programs
are
based
on
the
time
it
takes
a
typical
student
who
regularly
dedicates
10
hours
per
week
to
complete
the
program
The
actual
time
will
vary

CLASSROOM
MENTORSHIP
How
long
will
I
have
my
mentor?
For
students
enrolled
in
our
standard
Nanodegree
programs
your
mentor
will
be
with
you
through
your
successful
completion
of
Project
We
know
the
most
challenging
part
of
a
Nanodegree
program
is
often
just
getting
started
and
completing
those
initial
projects
so
we
want
to
ensure
you’re
set
up
for
success
on
the
right
track
and
that
you
have
the
best
possible
start
to
your
learning
journey
Plus
the
early
weeks
are
when
you’re
establishing
your
study
habits
and
and
schedule
and
mentors
are
a
great
resource
for
this
process
Students
enrolled
in
our
term-based
programs
(Self-Driving
Car
and
Artificial
Intelligence)
will
have
access
to
an
in-classroom
mentor
for
the
duration
of
their
enrollment
How
quickly
will
my
mentor
respond?
You
should
expect
check-ins
from
your
mentor
an
average
of
1-2x
a
day,
with
response
times
generally
never
being
longer
than
12
hours.
Each
relationship
will
of
course
be
slightly
different,
and
exceptions
may
of
course
occur,
but
this
should
be
your
general
expectation
How
often
can
I
engage
with
my
mentor?
You
will
have
a
private
chat
channel
that
is
always
available
in
your
classroom,
and
you
should
feel
free
to
communicate
there
as
often
as
you’d
like!
The
more
you’re
able
to
share
about
your
learning
experience,
your
study
habits,
your
successes
and
your
challenges,
the
better
able
your
mentor
will
be
to
provide
actionable
guidance
and
support.
Your
mentor
won’t
always
be
immediately
available
to
respond,
but
they’ll
regularly
review
your
correspondence
to
ensure
they’re
providing
the
help
you
need
How
do
I
communicate
with
my
mentor?
You
will
communicate
with
your
mentor
in
two
primary
ways:
1)
You
will
have
a
private
chat
channel
that
is
always
available
in
your
classroom,
and
2)
You
will
complete
a
weekly
check-in
in
which
you
set
specific
goals
for
your
next
week
of
learning.
Your
mentor
will
review
your
goals
and
give
you
feedback
on
how
best
to
proceed,
and
how
to
get
the
most
out
of
your
program!
Why
are
you
automatically
assigning
mentors?
In
an
ongoing
effort
to
determine
how
best
we
can
support
your
success
and
drive
your
progress,
we
regularly
research,
analyze,
and
test
different
support
strategies
and
initiatives,
and
it
is
wonderfully
clear
to
us
how
positive
an
influence
a
mentor
can
be
on
a
student’s
Nanodegree
program
experience.
While
each
student
will
be
able
to
determine
the
extent
to
which
they
rely
on
your
mentor
for
guidance
and
support,
we
feel
confident
that
having
a
mentor
to
track
your
progress
and
help
you
set
achievable
goals
will
have
a
positive
impact.
COMMUNITY
What
is
the
Udacity
community?
The
Udacity
community
consists
of
dedicated
digital
platforms
and
in-person
events
that
you,
as
a
Udacity
student
or
graduate,
have
the
opportunity
to
engage
with
to
help
you
further
your
personal
and
professional
goals.
Our
hope
is
that
the
Udacity
community
becomes
a
source
of
growth,
encouragement,
and
joy
for
every
student
throughout
every
stage
of
their
learning
journey,
starting
from
the
day
they
first
enter
the
Nanodegree
classroom
to
graduation
and
beyond.
Your
Nanodegree
program
may
include
access
to
discussion
forums,
Slack
channels,
other
chat
platforms,
or
you
may
have
opportunities
to
join
Udacity
Connect
sessions
depending
on
where
you
live.
We
want
students
to
use
these
platforms
to
freely
ask
and
answer
questions;
to
share
advice,
adversity,
and
accomplishments,
and
to
feel
connected
and
at
home
during
your
time
here.
Many
of
our
most
successful
alums
say
that
the
Udacity
community
is
a
big
part
of
what
made
their
experience
valuable
and
enjoyable--they
often
learned
as
much
from
their
classmates
as
they
did
in
the
classroom!
By
posting
in
our
forums
and
other
community
channels,
which
are
available
to
all
students
around
the
world
(180
countries
and
counting!),
you
are
contributing
to
the
creation
of
a
culture
that
celebrates
collaborative,
lifelong
learning
and
mutual
support.
What
are
the
benefits
of
being
a
community
member?
Your
Nanodegree
community
is
made
up
of
current
students
and
alumni
today,
but
the
people
you
meet
now
may
one
day
be
potential
collaborators,
co-workers,
or
employers
down
the
road.
Fostering
authentic
relationships
as
a
student
will
serve
you
well,
personally
and
professionally,
down
the
road.
What
is
a
community
violation
and
how
are
they
handled?By

our

you

by
our
Terms
of

We
know
that
legalese
is
tedious,
but
in
this
case
we
encourage
you
to
give
it
a
read
anyway
as
it
serves
to
protect
us,
and
by
extension,
your
data

student
experience,
from
unsavory
folks.

EARNING
A
CERTIFICATE
Do
I
need
to
take
each
course
in
the
Nanodegree
program
track
in
order
to
receive
a
Nanodegree
credential?No.
All
you
need
to
do
to
earn
a
Nanodegree
credential
is
to
submit
completed
projects
that
pass
required
specifications.
If
you
already
have
the
skills
you
need
to
complete
a
project,
you
can
submit
it
immediately
and
move
on
to
the
next
project
in
your
Nanodegree
program
portfolio.
The
content
is
there
to
teach
you
the
skills
needed
to
complete
the
portfolio
projects,
should
you
need
the
help.
Are
there
deadlines
within
each
program?
We
provide
project
deadlines
in
order
to
keep
students
on
track
to
graduate
within
our
recommended
timeframe.
These
dates
are
created
to
accommodate
a
student
who
can
dedicate
at
least
10
hours
per
week
to
the
Nanodegree
program.
If
you
miss
a
deadline,
don't
worry!
There
are
no
penalties
for
missing
a
project
deadline
so
just
do
your
best
to
catch
up.
You
can
always
reach
out
to
your
peers
and
coaches
for
extra
support
in
meeting
project
deadlines.
Is
there
a
final
exam?
There
are
no
final
exams
in
the
traditional
sense.
We
do
test
your
skills
by
having
you
complete
portfolio-ready
projects.
Nanodegree
programs
require
you
to
complete
between
5
to
8
projects
to
earn
the
credential.
Sometimes
we’ll
provide
some
final
questions
to
help
you
solidify
the
concepts
you’ve
learned,
but
they
are
not
required
to
earn
the
credential.
What
are
the
minimum
requirements
to
graduate
from
a
Nanodegree
program?
Minimum
requirements
include
meeting
specifications
for
all
required
projects
and
completing
all
graduation
requirements.
You
will
also
need
to
pay
for
at
least
one
month.
How
are
your
Nanodegree
credentials
awarded?
Udacity
credentials
will
be
awarded
based
on
successful
completion
of
all
the
required
components
of
a
program.
After
successfully
completing
your
projects,
your
identity
will
be
verified
and
you
may
be
asked
to
do
an
exit
interview.
Upon
successful
completion
of
this
process,
you
will
receive
an
official
Udacity
Nanodegree
credential.
Do
I
get
a
certificate
once
I
graduate
from
my
Nanodegree
program?
Yes!
You’ll
be
able
to
access
your
certificate
through
your
Udacity
account.
SELF
PACED
NANODEGREE
PROGRAM
Are
self-paced
programs
eligible
for
50%
back?
Self-paced
programs
are
eligible
for
the
50%
back
reimbursement
as
long
as
the
program
is
not
the
Plus
variant
and
the
program
is
completed
within
12
months
of
the
subscription
start
date.
How
much
does
a
self-paced
program
cost?
Self-paced
programs
are
charged
on
a
monthly
subscription
basis.
The
exact
monthly
cost
differs
depending
on
region
and
program.
NANODEGREE
PLUS
What
is
Nanodegree
Plus?
Our
Nanodegree
Plus
offering
is
a
Nanodegree
program
with
a
job
guarantee
included!
You
are
guaranteed
a
job
within
6
months
of
graduating,
or
you
receive
a
100%
tuition
discount.
This
is
an
ideal
program
for
the
job-focused
and
money-minded
learner,
because
your
education
is
paid
for
either
way:
you
get
a
job
at
which
you
earn
the
money
to
cover
your
tuition
expenses,
or
you
get
those
expenses
refunded!
How
is
Nanodegree
Plus
different
from
the
regular
Nanodegree
program?
Nanodegree
Plus
includes
all
the
features
and
benefits
of
all
of
our
Nanodegree
Programs,
but
includes
the
job
guarantee
described
above.
Because
the
focus
is
on
getting
hired,
Nanodegree
Plus
students
benefit
from
additional
career
support
and
placement
services
that
are
not
part
of
the
regular
Nanodegree
program
benefits.
PROJECTS
AND
REVIEW
SUBMITTING
A
PROJECT
When
will
my
project
be
reviewed?
Project
reviews
are
often
completed
in
about
24
hours,
something
that
Udacity
strives
for!
As
noted
in
your
student
handbook,
"Due
to
the
high
volume
of
submissions
and
the
time
it
may
take
your
project
reviewer
to
give
personalized
feedback,
the
turnaround
period
for
project
evaluations
may
be
up
to
1
week."
Your
student
handbook
can
be
found
in
your
"Resources"
section
in
your
student
portal.
Who
grades
Udacity
projects?
Udacity
reviewers
come
from
different
backgrounds,
live
in
different
parts
of
the
globe,
and
come
by
their
expertise
by
different
routes.
But
they
are
united
in
3
critical
ways:
Their
skills
are
exemplary,
and
their
knowledge
is
exceptional.
They
are
committed
to
your
success.
Their
work
is
consistently
monitored
to
ensure
it
embodies
Udacity
values,
and
meets
Udacity
standards.
How
does
grading
work
at
Udacity?
For
each
project
you
work
on,
we
provide
you
with
everything
you
need
to
successfully
complete
it,
including
the
rubric
we
use
to
grade
it.
Once
you've
completed
the
project,
and
checked
it
against
the
rubric,
you
submit
it
through
our
site.
A
reviewer
will
use
the
same
rubric
to
assess
your
submission.
They
will
evaluate
each
component,
and
also
review
your
code
(when
applicable)
line-by-line.
Your
project
will
be
given
a
Meets
Specifications
grade
if
you've
successfully
completed
the
rubric
requirements.
If
the
reviewer
determines
that
one
or
more
items
were
not
met,
you
will
receive
a
Requires
Changes
grade.
You'll
need
to
make
the
necessary
corrections,
then
submit
again.

How
do
I
cancel
a
project
submission?
If
the
option
is
available
you
can
now
cancel
a
project
submission
after
it
has
been
made.
Once
a
project
has
been
picked
up
to
review
you
will
not
have
the
option
to
cancel
your

If
you
would
like
to
cancel
your
submission
for
a
project
you
will
first
want
to

access,
our
hiring
partners
will
have
exclusive
access
to
your
profile
through
Talent
Source,
a
directory
to
search
and
find
highly
qualified

you
using
the
email
address

LinkedIn
or
Github
if
you
have
those
linked.
If
I
have
a

certificate,
will
a
company
sponsor
me
for
a
work
visa
to
work

BILLING
AND
PAYMENTS
How
much
does
it
cost
to
enroll
in
a
Udacity
Nanodegree
program?
How
much
a
Nanodegree
program
costs
varies
program
to
program
and
sometimes
by
your
own
learning
pace.
We
recommend
looking
at
the
Overview
Page
of
the
Nanodegree
program
you
are
interested
in
to
understand
how
much
it
will
cost
you.
Does
Udacity
offer
discounts
or
coupons
for
college
or
university
students?
While
we
don’t
offer
discount
directly
to
college
and
university
students,
we
have
partnered
with
GitHub
to
offer
a
special
discount
to
members
of
their
Student
Developer
Pack.
You
can
learn
more
about
this
program
here.
What
payment
methods
do
you
accept?
At
this
time
we
only
accept
debit
or
credit
cards.
We
hope
to
add
more
payment
options
in
the
near
future.
How
does
the
free
trial
work?
When
you
enroll
in
a
Nanodegree
program,
your
free
trial
begins
immediately.
During
your
free
trial
period,
you
have
access
to
moderated
forums
for
your
program,
and
all
features
that
come
with
a
paid
enrollment.
You
will
not
be
able
to
graduate
from
the
program
and
earn
a
credential
however,
while
on
your
free
trial.
We
highly
recommend
taking
advantage
of
as
many
features
as
you
can
during
the
free
trial
so
you
can
make
an
informed
decision
about
whether
the
program
is
a
good
fit
for
you.
If
you
opt
to
continue
the
program,
you
don’t
have
to
do
anything
further.
Your
card
will
automatically
be
charged.
You
can
cancel
your
subscription
anytime
during
the
free
trial.
When
will
I
be
billed?
You
will
be
billed
at
the
end
of
your
free
trial.
After
that,
you
will
be
charged
on
that
same
day
every
month.
For
example,
if
you
enroll
for
a
course
with
a
7
day
free
trial
on
July
1st,
your
first
payment
will
be
on
July
8th.
And
every
monthly
payment
after
that
will
be
due
on
the
8th
(August
8th,
September
8th,
and
so
on).
What’s
the
difference
between
pausing
and
canceling?
Pausing
your
subscription
maintains
your
original
start
date,
and
the
tuition
you've
paid
up
to
that
point
remains
eligible
for
the
50%
tuition
discount.
Canceling
your
subscription
means
you'll
need
to
re-enroll
when
you
wish
to
start
again.
You'll
receive
a
new
start
date,
and
only
your
tuition
payments
going
forward
will
be
eligible
for
the
50%
tuition
discount.
How
can
I
pause
my
Nanodegree
program?
You
can
pause
during
your
Nanodegree
program
for
either
7,
14,
or
30
days
by
going
to
your
account
settings
here.
During
your
pause
time,
you
will
not
have
access
to
your
learning
path,
mentor
support
services,
code
reviews,
or
the
forum.
You
also
will
not
be
billed.
Your
progress
will
be
saved
and
you
can
pick
up
where
you
left
off
after
you
un-pause.
Your
Nanodegree
program
will
automatically
un-pause
after
this
selected
time
period,
and
we’ll
send
you
a
reminder
beforehand
via
email.
If
you’d
like
to
start
learning
again
before
your
pause
period
has
ended,
you
can
un-pause
at
any
time.
Not
all
programs
are
eligible
to
pause.
Programs
such
as
Self-Driving
Car
Nanodegree
program
do
not
have
the
option.
How
is
my
billing
impacted
when
I
pause
an
enrollment?
When
you
pause
your
subscription,
you
may
be
mid-way
through
a
month
you
already
paid
for.
We
keep
track
of
the
remaining
credit
of
this
month
and
you
do
not
get
billed
while
your
subscription
is
paused.
When
your
subscription
unpauses,
you
will
be
billed
for
the
next
month
with
the
credit
amount
applied.
How
do
I
cancel
my
subscription?
You
may
cancel
your
subscription
by
going
to
your
account
settings.
You
will
continue
to
have
access
to
all
Udacity
features
until
the
end
of
your
last
billing
term.
What
happens
to
my
progress
when
I
cancel
my
subscription?
We
will
always
save
your
progress
so
if
you
need
to
take
a
break
and
come
back,
you
can
continue
from
where
you
left
off.
What
is
50%
back?
Through
our
"50%
back"
program,
you
earn
a
50%
tuition
discount
when
you
graduate
with
12
months
of
your
enrollment
date.
It's
a
key
way
we
can
invest
in
YOUR
future!
For
more
information,
check
out
this
page.
Who
is
eligible
for
50%
back?
To
be
eligible
for
50%
back:
you
need
to
be
in
a
self-paced
Nandoegree
program
you
cannot
be
enrolled
in
Plus
you
need
to
graduate
from
your
Nanodegree
program
within
one
year
of
your
start
date
you
need
to
be
the
one
paying
for
your
Nanodegree
program.
You
are
not
eligible
if
your
employer
is
paying
for
the
program.
Does
using
a
coupon
disqualify
me
from
50%
back?
Nope!
Your
total
spent
on
the
Nanodegree
program
will
simply
be
a
lower
amount,
and
you’ll
be
reimbursed
based
on
the
amount
you
spent.
Can
I
get
50%
back
for
more
than
one
Nanodegree
program?
Yes!
As
long
as
you
are
eligible,
we
will
process
your
50%
tuition
discount
for
every
Nanodegree
program
you
graduate
from.
Many
of
our
students
use
their
50%
discount
from
one
Nanodegree
program
to
pay
for
their
next
Nanodegree
program!

I

one
of
the

incorrectly,
whom

I

Quizzes
and
problem
sets
are
evaluated
by
an
automated
system.
While
we
make
every
effort
to
ensure
that
this
works
perfectly,
we
occasionally
make
mistakes
that
could
cause
incorrect
evaluations
of
your
work.
If
you
think
one
of
your
answers
has
been
evaluated
incorrectly,
please
send
us
a

with
all
the

If
we

If

An

there
are
often
restrictions
on
YouTube
in
certain

Unfortunately,
these

If

COURSE
CONTENT
What
is
a
Udacity
course
like?
Udacity
courses
are
highly
interactive
with
activities
such
as
quizzes
and
exercises
interspersed
between
short
videos
and
interviews
with
instructors
and
industry
experts.
The
quizzes
are
a
tool
to
help
you
learn,
and
an
ongoing
resource,
so
you
can
watch
the
videos
and
try
the
quizzes
as
many
times
as
you
like.
Usually,
after
a
lesson
there
will
be
a
problem
set
with
exercises
for
you
to
reaffirm
that
you
have
learned
the
material.
Just
as
with
the
quizzes,
you
can
try
them
as
many
times
as
you
like.
Udacity
courses
also
include
a
project
that
you
can
add
to
your
portfolio.
Whether
it
is
a
blog,
search
engine,
game
or
app,
Udacity
will
help
you
build
something
that
publicly
demoates
your
skills.
How
do
I
know
which
course
to
take?
Udacity
courses
are
roughly
categorized
as
“Beginner,”
“Intermediate,”
and
“Advanced.”
.
Beginner
classes
are
suited
for
those
who
have
little
to
no
prior
knowledge
of
the
subject.
Intermediate
classes
generally
require
some
prior
knowledge,
but
this
can
often
be
acquired
as
you
go.
Advanced
courses
require
significant
familiarity
with
the
subject
area.
Every
course
page
also
includes
a
“What
do
I
need
to
know?”
section,
which
gives
a
list
of
prerequisites
that
will
help
you
succeed.
Do
you
offer
any
certificates
for
free?
We
do
not
offer
an
option
of
earning
a
free
certificate.
Think
of
free
courses
as
a
textbook.
Anyone
is
welcomed
to
read
the
textbook
but
the
publisher
would
confirm
whether
or
not
you
read
the
book.
Our
free
courses
work
in
a
similar
way;
we
make
them
available
for
students
to
learn
on
their
own
but
we
do
not
offer
verifications
of
their
completion.
If
you
are
looking
to
earn
a
certificate,
take
a
look
at
our
Nanodegree
credentials.
Can
I
get
college
credit
for
Udacity
courses?
Are
you
accredited?
Udacity
is
not
an
accredited
institution
and
we
do
not
directly
provide
college
credit.
We
have,
however,
partnered
with
Georgia
Tech
to
offer
an
accredited,
fully
online
Master’s
Degree
in
Computer
Science.
While
the
courses
are
hosted
on
Udacity,
the
degree
is
conferred
by
Georgia
Tech.

How
do
I
access
subtitles?
All
Udacity
course
videos
have
English
subtitles.
Subtitles
may
also
be
available
in
other
languages,
such
as
Spanish,
Chinese,
French,

Udacity
Coaches
create
downloadable
supplemental
resources
for
Nanodegree

as
well.
These

which
are
summaries
of
concepts
from
a
lesson,
select
video
screenshots
and

How
do
I
get
answers
to
questions
I
have
related
to
the
courses?
We
support
an
active
learning
community,
and
encourage
you
to
post
your
questions
to
the
course
forums.
There,
your
peers
will
often
provide
rich
and
helpful
answers.
In
addition,
Nanodegree
students
have
access
to
separate
forum
where
our
Coaches,
mentors,
and
instructors
actively
provide
answers
and
commentary.
How
do
I
thank
someone
for
their
answer?
If
you’d
like
to
thank
someone
for
their
contribution,
feel
free
to
“heart”
a
post.
You
can
also
respond
to
the
topic,
letting
them
know
that
you
appreciate
their
comment.
What
should
I
NOT
do
in
the
forums?
Since
this
is
a
community
forum,
we
have
a
few
rules
to
make
sure
everyone
is
getting
the
most
out
their
experience.
Do
not
post
the
solution
to
a
problem,
especially
when
someone
only
asks
for
a
hint.
Do
not
post
comments
that
create
a
judgmental
or
unwelcoming
environment
for
others.
Other
students
do
have
the
ability
to
report
inappropriate
posts
to
Udacity,
so
please
consider
everyone
who
is
using
the
forums
before
posting.
Discriminatory,
abusive,
or
otherwise
negative
content
will
not
be
permitted.
How
do
I
use
the
discussion
forum?
If
you’re
new
to
the
forums,
welcome!
The
forums
are
where
you
can
post
ideas
and
thoughts
you
have
about
courses,
programs,
and
projects,
and
ask
questions
and
receive
feedback
from
other
students.
The
forum
is
an
important
social
and
learning
element
of
the
classroom
and
we
encourage
free
flowing
conversation
in
a
friendly,
open
atmosphere.
If
you’re
uncomfortable
about
posting
in
English,
we
hope
you
will
post
in
your
own
language
rather
than
not
post
at
all.
Are
there
assignments?
At
Udacity,
we
firmly
believe
in
learning
by
doing,
and
we
have
built
our
courses
and
programs
to
focus
on
building
real
projects,
and
solving
real
problems.
For
example,
each
course
includes
a
number
of
problem
sets.
They
do
not
have
due
dates,
and
you
are
not
assessed
based
on
the
work
you
do
in
these
problem
sets.
But,
you
do
receive
instant
feedback,
and
you
can
try
them
as
many
times
as
you
like
in
order
to
ensure
you’ve
mastered
the
relevant
concepts
and
skills.
Nanodegree
programs
do
include
larger
portfolio
projects
that
help
demonstrate
your
learning.
For
Nanodegree
students,
these
projects
will
receive
personal
feedback
from
individual
graders,
and
will
need
to
pass
certain
criteria
in
order
to
meet
program
completion
requirements.
How
can
I
get
the
most
out
of
Udacity
courses?
To
get
the
most
out
of
any
Udacity
program,
it’s
important
to
be
an
active
learner.
Make
time
for
learning
as
regularly
as
possible
and
be
sure
to
do
the
exercises!
Reach
out
to
your
peers
and,
if
you
are
in
a
Nanodegree
program,
take
advantage
of
the
Coach-moderated
forums
early
and
often.
Share
your
learning
and
career
goals.
Lastly,
be
sure
to
spend
plenty
of
quality
time
on
your
portfolio
projects.
You
will
learn
the
most
by
doing.

ROBOTICS
NANODEGREE
PROGRAM
Why
should
I
enroll
in
the
Robotics
Nanodegree
program
The
field
of
robotics
is
growing
fast
and
the
demand
for
engineers
with
the
right
skills
exceeds
the
current
supply
This
program
represents
unique
opportunity
to
develop
these
in-demand
skills
We
are
partnering
with
the
best
companies
in
the
field
of
robotics
to
offer
in-depth
curriculum
expert
instructors
and
exclusive
hiring
opportunities
You
will
come
out
of
this
program
having
completed
several
hand-on
robotics
projects
both
in
simulation
and
on
real
hardware
that
will
serve
as
portfolio
pieces
that
demonstrate
the
skills
you’ve
acquired
This
is
an
ideal
program
for
anyone
seeking
to
launch
or
advance
a
career
in
this
incredible
field
What
kinds
of
topics
will
the
Robotics
Nanodegree
program
cover
The
program
will
cover
topics
including
perception
localization
path
planning
and
control
Computer
Vision
and
machine
deep
learning
techniques
for
robot
perception
will
also
be
covered
as
well
as
the
Robot
Operating
System
and
an
introduction
to
robotic
hardware
systems
How
is
the
Robotics
Nanodegree
program
different
from
your
Machine
Learning
Engineer
Nanodegree
program
or
your
Self-Driving
Car
Engineer
Nanodegree
program
The
Machine
Learning
Engineer
Nanodegree
program
is
the
most
general
of
the
three
programs
It
offers
a
great
foundation
and
is
an
excellent
choice
for
anyone
pursuing
a
career
in
a
field
where
machine
learning
techniques
are
used.
However,
the
curriculum
is
not
as
advanced
as
the
other
two
programs,
and
it
does
not
specialize
to
the
same
extent.
The
Machine
Learning
Engineer
program
is
not
an
official
prerequisite
for
either
the
Self-Driving
Car
or
Robotics
programs,
though
it
may
be
beneficial
to
some
students
to
complete
this
program
first
know
depending
on
your
existing
knowledge
and
experience
The
Robotics
program
provides
an
introduction
to
various
aspects
of
robotics
including
perception
localization
path
planning
and
control
as
well
as
the
Robot
Operating
System
All
of
the
techniques
required
to
complete
the
projects
in
the
Robotics
program
including
machine
learning
are
taught
as
part
of
the
program.
The
Self-Driving
Car
Nanodegree
is
a
specialized
robotics
program
it
uses
robotics
concepts
and
applies
them
to
a
selfdriving
car
